        <li>4 cups powdered sugar (500g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Instructions</h3>
    <h4>White Cake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F and prepare two 8-inch round cake pans by lining the bottoms with a round of parchment paper and generously greasing and flouring the sides. Be sure to shake out excess flour.
        <li>In a stand mixer (or using an electric mixer), beat butter on medium-low speed until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and oil and beat until all ingredients are well-combined and creamy.</li>
        <li>Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and then stir in your vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In separate bowl, whisk together your flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Measure out your milk.</li>
        <li>With mixer on medium speed, gradually alternate between adding the flour mixture and the milk to the butter mixture, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Stir until each one is almost completely combined before adding the next.</li>
        <li>Pause occasionally to scrape down sides and bottom of bowl.</li>
        <li>In separate bowl combine your egg whites and using a hand-mixer on high-speed beat until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, gently fold your egg whites into your batter. Take care to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl so that ingredients are well-combined, and take care not to over-mix.</li>
        <li>Evenly divide cake batter into prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake on 350F for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake layer comes out clean or with few crumbs (should not be wet). For best results, rotate your cake pans halfway through baking to ensure even baking.</li>
        <li>Cakes will be a light golden brown when done baking.</li>
        <li>Remove cakes from oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the inside rim of each pan and invert each onto a cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool completely before covering with cream cheese frosting.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cream Cheese Frosting</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer (or you may use an electric mixer) and beat until creamy, well-combined, and lump-free.</li>
        <li>Add vanilla extract and salt and stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>With mixer on low, gradually add powdered sugar until completely combined.</li>
        <li>Use to frost completely cooled cake or cupcakes.</li>
    </ol>
